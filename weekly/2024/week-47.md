## Week 47 (November 19th â€“ November 25th)

- Packit now uses the fedora-distro-aliases library to expand Fedora aliases.
  This is Packit's original code being improved and properly maintained by the Copr team.
  For further suggestions about aliases, use github.com/rpm-software-management/fedora-distro-aliases.
  ([packit#2470](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2470))
