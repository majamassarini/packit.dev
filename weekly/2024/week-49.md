## Week 49 (December 3rd â€“ December 9th)

- It's finally here! The team is planning to release Packit 1.0.0! We want to take this opportunity to clean up long-time deprecated config options and a related code.
  To not let you alone in this, you can expect a pull request with required changes in case you are affected.
  More information about this change can be found on [a separate page](https://packit.dev/posts/packit_1_0_0_action_required).
