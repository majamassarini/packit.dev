## Week 6 (February 4th â€“ February 10th)

- Packit doesn't attempt to upload git-tracked remote sources (for example
  a [GPG keyring](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#_verifying_signatures))
  to lookaside cache anymore when syncing release.
  ([packit#2518](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2518))
- Dashboard pagination has been changed from infinite loading to page-based.
  ([dashboard#500](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/500))
