## Week 16 (April 16th â€“ April 22nd)

- The `--resultdir` argument in `build_in_mock` now defaults to the current directory (`"."`), preventing loss of build artifacts when not explicitly set. ([packit#2567](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2567))
- `tf_extra_params` should now be included when submitting the automatic upstream installability check to the Testing Farm. ([packit-service#2779](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2779))
